# PDF-CONVERTER
The code is a program that converts image files (JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.) into PDF format, scanning a designated folder and its subfolders for image files and converting them to PDF. It also deletes the original image files, leaving only the PDF versions, and displays a success message after completing all conversions and deletions.Please, open the PDF-CONVERTER.IPYNB file above to access the project
